# MC-Check
A project for mass checking a list of MC names to ensure availibilty

## About
Originally intended as a tool to be sold, I've decided to officialy open source this tool. The code in it, for lack of better words, is quite crap.
The threading model is aids aswell, and I'd recommend you not use it in production code.
## Getting Started
My shitty ass auth code is still in here, so just remove it and compile it and you'll be on your merry way :)
